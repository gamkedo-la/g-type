DEMO STORY (INTRO)

<-------------------------------------->
Year: 2276
United Sol Force ships at the edge of
the galaxy discovered an unknown ship in
distress. USF crew landed on the ship to
to scan for survivors. They found 
powerful technology and a message: 
THE KRAMMIX WILL DESTROY!

The scans triggered an alarm and opened 
a wormhole to the Krammix home world. 
The ship disappeared into the wormhole 
taking some of the USF ships and helpless 
crew with it. The USF used the alien 
technology to build an experimental ship 
known as G-Type! 

Your Mission: Follow the alien ship, 
rescue the lost USF crew and stop the 
evil plans of the Krammix!
