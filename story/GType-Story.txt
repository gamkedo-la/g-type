G-Type Story Basics - WORK IN PROGRESS

1. On the frontier in space
2. A distress signal was found
3. Friendly ships were sent in to investigate and they vanished
4. The specialized G-Type force ship is brought in to investigate
5. G-Type discovers an evil alien armada that spreading through the galaxy and devastating everything in its path.

Your mission is to find out what happened to the vanished ships and stop the alien armada!

A fun twist could be that when you finally reach the level where you find the missing ships, they've been repurposed by the alien armada into evil drones.

Love this idea.  I thought for the twist you were going down the Star Trek 1 (Voyager) route.  The invaders are the descendants of a very early (100’s or 1000’s of years ago) colonization effort which was lost and who has now forgotten where they came from.  So they’re human but neither of them knows it...

I thought something similar about having them get zombified by the aliens and then you have to destroy the zombie ships.  Maybe the boss from that level could be some angry, grotesque combination of the aliens and the missing ships.

Sounds good. Space zombies. How can we go wrong?
